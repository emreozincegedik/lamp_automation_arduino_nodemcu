# Lamp Remote Control

This is a project for lamp automation

- Lamp can be switched with both phone/pc via home wifi as well as wall switch
- D5 sees the status of the lamp so it can be removed if the lamp (or something else) is going to be only toggled

## Code usage

Code is written in Visual Studio Code with platformio plugin, if the Arduino IDE is going to be used, the **_code is in the src_** folder

as of now, lamp needs one output instead of 2 output. Efficiency...
